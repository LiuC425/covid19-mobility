# Project Mobility and Fuel Demand Under COVID-19

[covid19-mobility.com](https://covid19-mobility.com/)

During this COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a significant drop in mobility and fuel demand. We take a data-driven approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 statistics and states policy on personal mobility. To give you a role of thumb, the mobility quickly dropped as the number of confirmed cases increasing in March. Along with the decreasing of confirmed cases and the ease of stay home order from May, the mobility has gradually recovered. We also build a model to connect the mobility changes to fuel demand changes.

We then take the projected COVID-19 infection case numbers from the epidemiology model as inputs to predict future trends of mobility and fuel demand. We hope those projections could benefit economic and transportation energy planning and policy discussions.
