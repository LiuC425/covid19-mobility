# Machine Learning Model to Project the Impact of COVID-19 on U.S. Motor Gasoline Demand

## About of the Project

During this COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a significant drop in mobility and fuel demand. We take a data-driven approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 statistics and states policy on personal mobility. We also build a model to connect the mobility changes to fuel demand changes. We then take the projected COVID-19 infection case numbers from the epidemiology model as inputs to predict future trends of mobility and fuel demand.

## Code Structure

This repo hosts the source code and raw projection of the Pandemic Oil Demand Analysis (PODA) model.

* PODA Model source code: `/PODA_Model_Code`

* Raw projection data: `/fuel_demand_projections`

* Projection visulization: `/visulization_plotly`

You can find interactive visulizations of the projection and model details at [covid19-mobility.com](https://covid19-mobility.com/) and [teem.ornl.gov](https://teem.ornl.gov/poda.shtml).
